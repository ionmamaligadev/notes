# This workflow will build docker image and push it to Docker Hub
# The prerequisite is to have a docker hub account and create an auth token
# Also create a secret for github repo (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)
# The secrets should be named as follows DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD, where DOCKER_USERNAME is the username of your docker hub account
# and DOCKER_PASSWORD is the auth token created in docker hub

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
